            <p>My first brush with Web Development was when I was managing the website at my last job.
            However, I wasn't able to do any<strong>Other</strong> backend activities except changing information on the CMS.
            This spurned the curiosity to join Moringa School in order to gain the additional skills to enable do my work better.
